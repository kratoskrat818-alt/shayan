📊 Student Semester Attendance vs Performance Analysis
📌 Project Description

This project analyzes the relationship between student attendance and exam performance using simulated data.
The goal is to demonstrate how regular attendance can positively impact academic results through statistical analysis and data visualization.

The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and is fully compatible with Google Colab.

🚀 Features

Generates student attendance and exam score data

Provides statistical summaries of the dataset

Calculates correlation between attendance and exam scores

Visualizes results using scatter plots, trend lines, and pie charts

Categorizes students into performance levels (High, Medium, Low)

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset is synthetically generated for educational purposes and contains data for 100 students.

Columns:
Column Name	Description
Student_ID	Unique identifier for each student
Attendance_Percentage	Attendance rate (50%–100%)
Exam_Score	Exam score (0–100)
Performance_Level	Academic performance category
🔄 Workflow

Data Generation

Attendance values are randomly created

Exam scores are calculated based on attendance with added randomness

Statistical Summary

Displays mean, minimum, maximum, and distribution values

Correlation Analysis

Calculates Pearson correlation coefficient to measure relationship strength

Data Visualization

Scatter plot of attendance vs exam score

Trend line showing overall pattern

Pie chart showing performance distribution

Performance Categorization

High: Score ≥ 75

Medium: Score ≥ 50

Low: Score < 50

📈 Key Insights

Attendance and exam scores have a positive correlation

Higher attendance generally results in better exam performance

Visualizations clearly support statistical findings

Attendance plays an important role in academic success
